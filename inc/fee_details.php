        What is included in my Program Fee?
      </div>
      <div class="details_entry_caption_body">
        <p>
          The program fees listed above cover accommodation, food, orientation, transport, and in-country support staff throughout the duration of your volunteer placement. A small amount is also set aside for future program development. When you consider the costs you might incur at a hotel or eating at restaurants, the costs are minimal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plus, as Buwooya Child Care Ministries offers non-profit program fees, you know that every penny of your program fee is going directly to the local organisations and the people you have chosen to support. Our local partners are grassroot organisations, and in most cases are solely funded by volunteer fees. For them to be able to continue the amazing work they do, volunteer fees and donations are essential.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, it is a decision of where you would like your money to go... to a hotel, or to a local family? We know which one we'd choose!

        Why do I need to pay a registration fee?
      </div>
      <div class="details_entry_caption_body">
        <p>
          A Buwooya Child Care Ministries registration fee of US$249 is charged in addition to the program fees and is valid for 12 months from the start of your first intended placement.
          This fee is the ONLY source of income Buwooya Child Ministries receives, and is among the lowest of  all volunteer organisations (we encourage you to check!).
        </p>
        <p>
          This fee ensures pre- and post- placement support from Buwooya Child Care Ministries, checking and vetting local organisations and regularly reviewing our 100+ programs, a comprehensive information pack as well as administration and marketing costs.
          From the outset, we have kept our overheads down to ensure you pay the lowest possible fees. We do not spend your money on an office or company cars, like other organisations, weâ€™re just a team of passionate people from who love helping you help the world!

          Volunteers are also responsible for arranging and paying for their own flights, travel insurance, visas and vaccinations (if required), as well as any spending money they may require.

            <li>All transaction costs pertaining to online, bank or wire transfers are additional to the program fee and must be covered by the volunteer.</li>
