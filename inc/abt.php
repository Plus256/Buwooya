                <p>We are  non-profit ministry. Started by a Ugandan for his people. We are a small grassroots organization, which allows us to have a personal connection with each child.</p>
                <p>We focus on children and families living in extreme poverty in Uganda  by re-building communities and empowering today's Children and youth. We provide resources for students to excel academically and will not turn a child away due to age or religion.</p>
                <p>Our team of national staff and volunteers work directly with the children in various community outreach and education programs to improve their quality of life spiritually, emotionally, and physically.</p>
